<img align="right" width="200" height="300" src="assets/Wang_Yunsheng.jpg">

I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at [Kettering University](https://www.kettering.edu/). I received my PhD in Computer Science at Temple University in August, 2013, working under the supervision of [Prof. Jie Wu](https://cis.temple.edu/~wu/).

My research interests include various topics in the application and protocols of wireless networks. My current research focuses on Autonomous and Connected Vehicles from different aspects, including vehicle network communication, HD map navigation, vehicle edge computing, and vehicle cybersecurity.   

I am actively looking for self-motivated graduate/undergraduate students to join my research team.
